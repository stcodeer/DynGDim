Dissertation: “Graph Classification Algorithm Based on Diffusion Dynamics”.

Dynamic Graph Dimensionality is a methodology for computing the relative, local and global dimension of complex networks. 

This repository applies the algorithm to the field of graph classification, particularly in graph anomaly detection, and has achieved significant results.
